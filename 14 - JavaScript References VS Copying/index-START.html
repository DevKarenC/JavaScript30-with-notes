      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      let age = 100;
      let age2 = age;
      console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
      age = 200;
      console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100

      let name = "Wes";
      let name2 = name;
      console.log(name, name2); // "Wes", "Wes"
      name = "Wesley";
      console.log(name, name2); // "Wesley", "Wes"

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      // team is not a new array - it's a reference to the array players.
      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "Lux";
      console.log(team); // ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"]

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      // now here is the problem!
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
      console.log(players); // ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"]

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We make a copy instead!
      // one way using .slice()
      const team2 = players.slice();

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread Operator
      const team4 = [...players];

      // or use the Array.from() method
      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy (we CANNOT do this):
      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99;
      console.log(captain); // { name: "Wes Bos", age: 80, number: 99 }
      console.log(person); // { name: "Wes Bos", age: 80, number: 99 }

      // how do we make a copy instead?
      // use the Object.assign(target, ...sources) method
      const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
      console.log(captain2); // { name: "Wes Bos", age: 80, number: 99 }
      console.log(person); // { name: "Wes Bos", age: 80 }

      // We can also make a (shallow) copy of the object using ...spread syntax.
      // A shallow copy means that certain values (ex. nested objects)are still connected to the original variable.
      const captain3 = { ...person };
      console.log(captain3); // { name: "Wes Bos", age: 80 }

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: "wesbos.developer",
        },
      };

      const captain4 = Object.assign({}, wes);
      captain4.social.twitter = "coolman";
      console.log(captain4.social); // Object {twitter: "@coolman", facebook: "wesbos.developer"}
      // Because only a shallow copy was made, the original object is also affected.
      console.log(wes.social); // Object {twitter: "@coolman", facebook: "wesbos.developer"}

      // lodash library has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      // another way to deep clone using JSON.parse and JSON.stringify
      // JSON.stringify converts the object into a string, and JSON.parse turns it back into an object
      const captain5 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
